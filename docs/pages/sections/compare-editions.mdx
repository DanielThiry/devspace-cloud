You can either install and run DevSpace Cloud yourself (on-premise) **or** you can sign up for the SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) edition of DevSpace Cloud. In both cases, you will need to create a Kubernetes cluster for your team and [connect it to DevSpace Cloud (see step 2)](./connect-clusters.md).

||SaaS Edition|On-Premise Edition|
| --: | :--: | :--: |
|**DevSpace Cloud**|runs on <u>**our**</u> servers|runs on **your** servers|
|**Connected Clusters**|runs on **your** servers|runs on **your** servers|
|**Comparison to CI/CD**|DevSpace Cloud SaaS is like using a hosted CI/CD system (e.g. GitHub Action) to deploy to your own Kubernetes clusters|DevSpace Cloud On-Premise is like hosting your own CI/CD system (e.g. Jenkins) to deploy to your own Kubernetes clusters|

- **DevSpace Cloud** = Software that manages your connected clusters (consists of: Admin UI, API Server, Database)
- **Connected Clusters** = Kubernetes clusters that you connect to DevSpace Cloud (will be used to create namespaces)

:::note Example
This is what happens when you run `devspace create space my-namespace`:

1. The CLI will send a request to the API server of **DevSpace Cloud**.
2. DevSpace Cloud will then create a namespace called `my-namespace` inside one of your **Connected Clusters**.
3. DevSpace Cloud will return a service account token as a response to the API request.
4. The CLI will configure a new kube-context using this service account token.
5. You can use this kube-context to access the new namespace and deploy an application.

If you connect multiple clusters, the CLI will always ask you which one to use for creating the namespace.
