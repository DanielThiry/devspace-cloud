**Enable Sleep Mode** controls if the containers in a Space should be put to sleep when the user is not working with this Space for a certain amount of minutes.

DevSpace Cloud determines if a user is not actively using a Space based on the time past since the last interaction with the Kubernetes API server (e.g. using kubectl, helm etc.).
