When connecting a cluster to DevSpace Cloud, a control plane is installed into the cluster. One part of this control plane is Gatekeeper which enforces dynamic admission rules based on Open Policy Agent.

DevSpace Cloud defines a predefined set of admission control rules for Gatekeeper. You can add custom rules via <Highlight backgroundColor="#8fa6b2">Clusters ðŸ¡† [cluster-name] ðŸ¡† Rules</Highlight>
