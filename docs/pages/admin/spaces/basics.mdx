Spaces are Kubernetes namespaces that are managed through DevSpace Cloud. DevSpace CLI lets you create a kube-context for a Space, so you can access it directly with any Kubernetes tool, e.g. kubectl, helm or kustomize.

## Create Spaces

<FragmentCreateSpace />

## List Spaces
```bash
devspace list spaces
```

:::tip
Use the `--all` flag, if you are admin of a cluster or team and you want to see Spaces of others.
:::

## Use Spaces
```bash
devspace use space [optional:space-name]
```

:::tip
Prefix the Space name with `[username]:` (e.g. `john:space-1`), if you are admin of a cluster or team and you want to use another user's Space.
:::

## Remove Spaces
```bash
devspace remove space [space-name]
```

:::warning Data Loss
Deleting a Space will also delete the underlying Kubernetes namespaces, including all the persistent volumes created through this Space. Your data will be lost forever and cannot be recovered.
:::

:::note Kube-context
After deleting the Space, DevSpace will also remove the kube-context from your local kube-config file.
