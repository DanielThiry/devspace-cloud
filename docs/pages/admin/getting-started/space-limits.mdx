## Important Limits
The following limits are needed by many teams:

:::note Ingress Options ðŸ¡† Allowed Ingress Hosts
**Allowed Ingress Hosts** lets you define which hostnames the user can use when making an application publicly available on a domain (by creating an ingress).
:::

:::note Sleep Mode
**Enable Sleep Mode** controls if the containers in a Space should be put to sleep when the user is not working with this Space for a certain amount of minutes.
:::

:::note Templates
**Templates** allow admins to define which Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts should be created/installed inside every new Space the user creates.
