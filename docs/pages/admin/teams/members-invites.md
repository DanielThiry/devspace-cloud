It is generally <u>not</u> needed to invite people to a team. Instead, you should invite them directly to a team cluster because all cluster users of a team cluster will automatically become team members.

Take a look at [this page to learn how to invite people to a cluster](../getting-started/cluster-users.mdx).

:::warning Team Member â‰  Cluster Access
Although you can generate invite links just to add people to a team, these team members will not have any access to the clusters.
