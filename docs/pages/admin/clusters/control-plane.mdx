## Components
Each control plane consists of the following components:
- **Ingress Controller** for handling incoming traffic from (sub-) domains
- **Cert Manager** for provisioning SSL certificates via Letsencrypt
- **Admission Controller** for admission control
- **Gatekeeper** for dynamic admission control


## Upgrade Components
If a component is outdated, DevSpace Cloud will show an upgrade button next to the name of the component. Click on the button to upgrade the component.

## Install Components
If a component is currently not installed, DevSpace Cloud will show an install button (Plus-Icon) next to the name of the component. Click on the button to install the component into the cluster.

## Uninstall Components
If a component is currently installed, DevSpace Cloud will show an uninstall button (Trash-Icon) next to the name of the component. Click on the button to remove the component from the cluster.

:::warning Ingress Controller
Uninstalling and then reinstalling the ingress controller may change the IP address of the ingress controller which then needs to be updated in the DNS records of your Spaces domain.
:::

:::warning Gatekeeper &amp; Admission Controller
Uninstalling Gatekeeper and/or Admission Controller will lower your cluster security and lead to reduced isolation between cluster users and Spaces.
